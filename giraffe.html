                       <h3> GIRAFFE</h3>
                       <P>The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to nine extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other prehistoric species, known from fossils, are extinct.</P>
                       <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                       <p>Giraffes are mainly found grazing in savannahs around Africa, but in recent times, due to an increase in land being turned into farms and ranches for production for agriculture, their numbers have dwindled. 
As well as their land changing to be used by other means, another main contributor to the giraffeâ€™s loss of habitat is the charcoal industry. The need for charcoal means that many individuals in Africa are harvesting trees and then burning the wood. This can be hard for giraffes who rely on those trees as a source of nutrition.
